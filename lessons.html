            <h3>Ages 5, 6, and 7</h3>
            <p>
              My goal at the first few lessons is to get your child excited
              about the piano. In lesson one we start improvising on the black
              keys together. This is fun for the child and allows me to asses
              their musicality so we can set some long term goals. I don't begin
              with a method book because the main goal at the beginning is to
              create a passion for music and to develop musicality, not to earn
              stickers and work towards a certificate (although there's a place
              for that!).

            <p>
              Beginners at this age also receive a no-book approach at first.
              Eventually, we will use a method book to supplement aural skills
              training. I like to use the Piano Safari method for children.
              We'll also be implementing technology with games to learn music
              theory (things like note values). It's important to keep children
              excited about music, so we will always work on a song or tune that
              they enjoy along with the Piano Safari books.

            <h3>Ages 11 and up</h3>
            <p>
              As your child approaches teenage-hood, there are a few things to
              consider. Beginners will receive the same no-book approach at
              first, but will move faster through it. Many children at this age
              already have of some sort of musical background (even if just a
              little), and that will be taken into consideration. We'll continue
              moving through more advanced levels of method books, eventually
              leaving method books and entering a more intermediate level.

            <p>
              My goal at the first few lessons is to get my student excited
              about the piano. It's a low pressure environment that allows me to
              asses the student's musicality so we can set some long term goals.
              I don't begin with a method book because the main goal at the
              beginning is to create a passion for music and to develop
              musicality, not to earn stickers and work towards a certificate.
              Eventually, we will get into a method book to learn tecnique and
              theory, but we will always work on something the student wants to
              learn.

            <h3>Intermediate</h3>
            <p>
              Students at this level are usually moving out of a method book and
              into classical music. This is always a fun time in a piano
              student's growth, as a challenging piece of music is very
              rewarding to master. It's important to keep in mind that my goal
              is for the student to enjoy learning the piano, not to simply get
              a song up to tempo and then moving to the next song. We can also
              implement other styles of music, like jazz (which is what I
              studied in college!).

            <h3>Just for Fun</h3>
            <p>
              If you're a teen who simply wants to learn to play your favorite
              popular song, I can help with that. Students who are interested in
              learning to play chord symbols are sometimes also interested in
              writing their own music. The possibilities to this approach are
              really endless!

              have never stopped taking lessons." Well, I'm here to tell you,
              it's never too late! I will create a lesson plan for you that is
              built around your desires. I know you're busy and have enough
              stress, so you can expect an easy going, casual experience in my
              studio. Send me a message, let's talk about the music you like.

            <h3>Lessons Built for You</h3>
            <p>
              Regardless of age, I begin with a no-book approach for new
              students. There is no method book at first, and we'll focus on
              improvisation and having fun. My goal in the beginning is to get
              you excited about learning the piano and to find out what makes
              you tick. After the first few weeks (or maybe months!) of the
              no-book approach, we can get into learning to read music, chord
              charts, or whatever you like. The curriculum is built around your
              needs.

            <p>
              This is my wheel house! My full-time job is as a worship pastor at
              my church. I can teach you how to read chord charts, how to play
              in different keys, and how to feel comfortable and confident on
              the stage on Sunday morning. Eventually, you'll be able to hear a
              song on the radio or from your most recent favorite worship album
              and know exactly what is going on in the changes.
